Experiences Trying to Learn Rust

    Zachary: I used w3school to gain the understanding on the syntax. used rust documentation, google, and chatgpt for debugging. RustRover for the IDE, this was very helpful. Learning this was a bruteforce endeavor.

    Ben:

    Dayton: I found YouTube, some stack overflow, W3 Schools and the rust documentation to be incredibly helpful for learning rust. I kinda dived into the deep end with this project though, with threads and conditions variables, which I wouldn't necessarily recommend. I think W3 Schools is a great beginner resource, just trying the problems and testing code there is incredibly informative, to the point of making rust seem very easy to pick up at times. I think for more specific implementations though, such as threads and locks, YouTube and the rust documentation cannot be underestimated. For condition variables for example, I copied the example code provided by the rust documentation, and tried to go line by line and comment what I thought the code was doing, which helped my understanding of rust quite a lot.

    Ai was used to learn more about specific rust libraries and syntax, such as a global mutable vector, linked lists, getting code snippets to use as a reference for our own codebase. Small questions for information such as initializing and creating structs in rust were also asked, or more tedious tasks such as writing output to a file, using AI much like a Google search for it's in depth and easy to follow answers.

    Slight modifications and clarifications were necessary for further prompts to improve the AI output to better suit the project's needs. Questions were also asked about the code outputted as to better understand any code to be implemented into our codebase. Additionally, AI was helpful with the debugging process, with prompts to ask about what was wrong with our own code snippets to help understand errors we made and debug them.
